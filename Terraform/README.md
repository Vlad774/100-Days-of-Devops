| **Launch EC2 in Private VPC Subnet Using Terraform** | Provisioning a fully isolated network environment in AWS (VPC, Private Subnet) and deploying a secure EC2 instance accessible only from the internal CIDR.  | ✅ Done | `AWS` | [View Solution](./AWS/Launch-EC2-in-Private-VPC-Subnet-Using-Terraform/) |
| **Attach Elastic IP Using Terraform** | The Nautilus DevOps team has been creating a couple of services on AWS cloud. They have been breaking down the migration into smaller tasks, allowing for better control, risk mitigation, and optimization of resources throughout the migration process. Recently they came up with requirements mentioned below.  There is an instance named xfusion-ec2 and an elastic-ip named xfusion-ec2-eip in us-east-1 region. Attach the xfusion-ec2-eip elastic-ip to the xfusion-ec2 instance using Terraform only. The Terraform working directory is /home/bob/terraform. Update the main.tf file (do not create a separate .tf file) to attach the specified Elastic IP to the instance.  | ✅ Done | `AWS` | [View Solution](./AWS/Attach-Elastic-IP-Using-Terraform/) |
